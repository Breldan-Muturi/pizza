## Installation

To install the project it is necessary to follow these steps:


* Open https://github.com/Turi-byte/pizza. On the top right corner of your screen, you should see a button with the text 'Fork'. 
* Clicking on this button should start the process of copying the project/repository to your own account.Click on that button which should result in a modal prompting you to choose the account to which you want to fork.
* Select your account name which should take you to the repo you forked in your account. For example, if your GitHub username is 'Turi-byte', you should select it and not anything else that appears in the modal. This may take a couple of seconds so be patient as the process takes place.
* To know that the forking process is complete, check the top left corner of your repo. You should be in your account in a repo with the same name as the original repository (your_username/pizza). This shows that the forking process is complete.
* Having copied the repo to your own account, you can then proceed to clone it.Run the git clone command to clone the repo to your preferred location.
* Navigate to inside the cloned repository by using the change directory (cd) command.
* Open your editor by using the command atom . for Atom users or code . for Visual Studio Code users.
